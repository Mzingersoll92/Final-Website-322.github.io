<p> Agility is a primary attribute for 35 hereos within dota 2 at the moment. But, what does agility do within the game?</p>
<p> Agility is used for only two things within dota 2</p>
<ul>
  <li>It increases your attack speed by 1 for each point</a>
  <li>It increases your overall armor by 0.14 per point</a>
  <li>And if your hero has the primary attribute  of agility it increases their physical damage by 1 point</a>
</ul>
